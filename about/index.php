                  <h1>What We Do</h1>
		  <h3>Overview</h3>
                  <p>UNT Robotics is a broad engineering student organisation at the <a href="https://www.unt.edu/">University of North Texas</a>.</p>
				  <p>We focus on developing student's skills in engineering &amp; robotics, which involves a range of beginner workshops, industry talks, robotics-based hackathons, recreational projects and competitions.</p>
                  <p>We have invited several companies across disciplines such as L3, RoboKind, and StandardUser CyberSecurity. These companies were chosen because they fit the major demographics of our organization: Mechanical, Biomedical, and computer science/engineering.</p>
                  <p>In addition to these companies coming out, we also host workshops that teach how robotics work. They, like most of our general meetings, are open to all. These workshops taught our members from the basics of electronics all the way up to using Bluetooth communication to control robotics.</p>

                      <!--<h5><strong> echo AdminBot::get_member_count(); ?></strong> members from <strong> echo count(get_majors()); ?></strong> majors.</h5> this had php tags but i removed them-->
                      <h5><strong>433</strong> members from <strong>10</strong> majors.</h5>
                  </div>
                  <p>We've grown a lot since our conception in late 2018. UNT's Engineering program teaches students much of the theory of needed to flourish, however there was a gap for the invaluable hands on experience that we give our members. As a result, we've become a part of the growth and development of students here at UNT.</p>
                  <p>As a student organisation, we also develop the social skills of students. We host social and team building events and extensively network with industry partners who value the skills that we have given their recruits.</p>

                    <h3>Workshops</h3>
				        <p>We host bi-weekly workshops on topics from electrical circuits and programming microcontrollers to computer-aided design (CAD) and image processing. These workshops are tailored to teaching new skills to novices, they are perfect for new students to get a head start in their field or for students in other majors to branch our and learn about robotics.</p>
				        <p>The workshops consist of a 1-2 hour course held after our evening meetings where one can turn up with no knowledge of the topic and leave with tangible skills to take home. We provide all of the equipment needed and bring in experts to teach each workshop.</p>

                    <h3>Campus Involvement</h3>
                        <p>UNT Robotics has collaborated with the Society of Automotive Engineers where we are building their dash and assisting with their wiring harness. </p>
                        <p>UNT Robotics has hosted a meeting in collaboration with American Society of Mechanical Engineers where Bell Flights (Formerly Bell Helicopters) came out to talk. </p>
                        <p>UNT Robotics provided membership boosts and volunteers to Engineering United for HackUNT. We also hosted a meeting open to everyone where we discussed the best way to win a Hackathon. </p>
                        <p>UNT Robotics worked with Kappa Delta Pi, an education honor society, to host a STEM education workshop for future teachers where we discussed the Engineering portion of STEM. We taught programming using Scratch, gear ratios using LEGO, and computer structure and design using skits. </p>

                    <h3>Socials</h3>
				        <p>No student organisation is complete without the friends & family that one makes throughout their tenure. We develop our students as people, not just academically. The aspect of building relationships is just as important as any academic teaching because the relationships that students forge when taking part in our social events can improve their academic life by engaging with like-minded and driven individuals.</p>

                    <h3>Talks</h3>
				        <p>When professionals from diverse engineering fields come together to present for our members, they aren't just inspiring the next generation of engineers, but they are cultivating ideas, forming bonds, and imparting unparalleled strategies on how to navigate the job market. These invaluable opportunities provide our members with a unique competitive advantage when venturing out to apply for internships and careers that will empower them for a lifetime.</p>

                    <h3>Networking</h3>
                        <p>A big part of our development is encouraging & facilitating networking. This is mutually beneficial for the students and companies alike who love to recruit our alumni. We also have working relationships with companies who offer talks, parts and equipment and mentorship every semester.</p>

                    <h3>Botathon</h3>
				        <p>Founded in 2019, Botathon is a cross-disciplinary bracketed competition hosted by students, for students. It's themed exclusively each year to broaden the skill sets of the entrants. Our purpose is to inspire moments of creativity, enable personal and professional growth, and ignite change by sharing the power of engineering. We strive to lead each participant to become a leader in their team to nurture critical thinking and prepare them to find profound solutions to complex problems even after they graduate.</p>
                        <p>	During the course of 12 hours, teams are required to prioritize the planning and execution of the general principles adopted by that year of Botathon. All UNT students are eligible to enter for free, and materials for the robot build are provided as well as food, and prizes for the champions!</p>

                    <h3>Competitions</h3>
                        <p>Our collegiate team just came back from a competition in Louisiana where we competed in the IEEE R5 Autonomous Rover competition where we were commended for our mechanical engineering prowess.</p>
				        <p>Competitions create a platform for individuals to share, innovate, and build on ideas in the pursuit of discovery, development, and integrity. We aim to compel students to thrive by working together in challenging scenarios that make use of each individual's strengths while also improving shortcomings. For many, this is one of the first opportunities to work cross-disciplinary and see how other fields build upon their own, while also learning the basics of other disciplines simultaneously.</p>

                    <h3>Recreational Projects</h3>
				        <p>These fun projects are for anyone and everyone that just wants to have fun and work on a project together. These projects tend to be very long-term because we don't require any time commitment, allowing people to come and go as they wish. Anyone can propose a project to work on, and so long as they get a team together we will support them in building it.</p>

                    <h3>Equipment Checkout</h3>
				        <p>Equipment checkout is suspended due to COVID-19.</p>
